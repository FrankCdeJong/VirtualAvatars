### Git Large File Storage
Unity uses some large binary assets for 3D models, sounds, images, etc. (https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-git-with-unity) Git LFS must be installed. This replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise (https://git-lfs.github.com/).

Git Large File Storage can be installed from https://git-lfs.github.com/.


## Adding the virtualisation project to unity
